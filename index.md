Smart Mirror
Do you want a way to enliven your average mirror to where it has the same functionality as a smartphone? The smart mirror is a two way mirror that can display information behind a regular mirror, such as the time, weather, and news.

# Second Milestone

My second milestone was to start the finish building the frame of the mirror. The gaol is to attach the monitor and raspberry pi to the back of the mirror and make a wooden frame around it.

# First Milestone
  

The smart mirror is mainly composed of a raspberry pi, monitor, and mirror. My final milestone was to set up the raspberry pi and get the display of the smart mirror working. In order to do this, I had to first connect the rapsberry pi to the monitor using an HTMI cable. After connecting the raspberry pi to the monitor, I installed a few modules using terminal in the rapberry pi. However, during the process, I encountered several issues, including syntax errors and parsing errors. Even tough I ran into these issues, I was finally able to get the display working on the raspberry pi.
